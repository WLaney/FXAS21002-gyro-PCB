# FXAS21002 breakout PCB
This is a breakout board for the FXAS21002 IC. The FXAS21002 is a low power I2C gyroscope. In addition to I2C it has two interrupt pins, however only one is broken out in this design. 

This board was desgined in such a way to be pin compatable with [Sparkfun's MMA8452Q breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12756). 
These boards can be stacked to help save space in embedded projects.

This board was desgined as part of the Sharkduino Project at The College of William and Mary, more information can be found at [sharkduino.com](http://www.sharkduino.com)
